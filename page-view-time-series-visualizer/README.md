# Page View Time Series Data Visualization

This project visualizes time series data of page views on the freeCodeCamp forum using various plots.

## Files

- `time_series_visualizer.py`: Contains the code for creating line, bar, and box plots.
- `fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (should be present in the same directory).

## Features

- **Line Plot**: Daily freeCodeCamp forum page views from 5/2016 to 12/2019.
- **Bar Plot**: Average daily page views for each month, grouped by year.
- **Box Plot**: Year-wise and month-wise distribution of page views.

## Usage

1. Ensure the dataset (`fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`) is in the same directory.
2. Run `main.py` to generate the plots.
